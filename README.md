# Personal Website Project  

I am building a **personal website** from scratch to showcase my portfolio and skills. This project also serves as a hands-on opportunity to:  

- Explore **GitHub Codespaces** as a powerful cloud-based development environment, adding this tool to my skillset.  
- Improve proficiency in the **Linux terminal**, which has been both a challenge and a rewarding experience.  

## Project Highlights  

- **Custom Design:** From layout to interactivity, everything is built from the ground up.  
- **Tech Stack:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript.  
- **Goal:** Demonstrating clean, maintainable code while learning new tools and refining my web development expertise.
